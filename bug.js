The issue arises when using Firebase's `FieldValue.serverTimestamp()` within a transaction.  Under high concurrency, the transaction might fail intermittently with an error similar to `Error: Write on snapshot with pending write`. This isn't a typical Firebase error message, making it harder to debug. The root cause appears to be a race condition where multiple clients attempt to update the same document simultaneously using server timestamps, leading to conflicting writes and transaction failures. The problem is exacerbated when dealing with multiple concurrent updates to a single field.
